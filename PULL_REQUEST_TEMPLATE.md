#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Meagan and Maithrika paired together. It took about 2 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on reading the DONE TODOs to familiarize ourselves with the newly added logic.
  2. Next, we started working on the fetchAll function -- we first added instructions for when hackerIpsum is not found in localStorage. Then we worked on the logic for when it was already in localStorage. Finally, we added function calls from the prewritten functions.
  3. Lastly, we called our fetchAll function in articleView.js.
